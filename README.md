Drop by Drop
    This game is designed for charity: water.
    The objective of the game is to connect each pipe from the water source to the village.
    The player must click on each pipe to rotate it correctly. If the pipe is connected correctly on one or both sides, the pipe will highlight green. For the level to be completed, the pipes must be connected correctly to move on.
    There is a 30 second timer, giving the player a timeframe to complete the puzzle before they must restart a new puzzle. Each puzzle is randomly generated with at least one ensured pipe required to rotate by the player for the level to be complete. When multiple levels are completed consecutively, the streak score will increase. This score will reset to zero when a level is failed.
